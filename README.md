# ☕ CoffeeShop Website – Frontend Project

Welcome to the CoffeeShop Project! This is a responsive, accessible, and visually engaging frontend website developed as part of the [TripleTen Software Engineering Program](https://tripleten.com/). It showcases a clean and modern layout for a fictional coffee shop, demonstrating strong skills in semantic HTML, modern CSS (including Flexbox), and accessible design principles.
